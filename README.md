React Quiz App
React Quiz App

I'm excited to share my latest project 🚀: a React quiz app built with ReactJS and React hooks 🛠️. In this interactive game 🎮, you can enter your name, play quizzes 📝, and answer a total of 15 questions ⁉️. At the beginning of the game, a unique sound 🎶 will welcome you. As you select the correct answer 👍, the options will turn into green boxes 🟩 accompanied by a sound effect 🔈. Conversely, if you choose the wrong answer 👎, the box will turn red 🟥, and you'll hear another sound effect 🔈.

Features
Enter your name to get started.
Play the quiz and answer 15 challenging C++ questions 🐍.
Enjoy interactive sound effects 🎶 based on your choices.
See how much money you earned 💰 if you lose the game 🥴.
